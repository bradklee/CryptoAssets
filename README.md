# CryptoAssets
Data for Water Tiger Year 2022 coding challenge.

Raw Data in ExCrypt1 & ExCrypt2 encrypted using 
pads in ExampleAG3Ds (3D Autoglyphs).

These are PoC examples, so 8 characteristic pads
have been reused, sorry not sorry.

Upcomming Contest will use one-time pads generated
from a stream of secret keys.
